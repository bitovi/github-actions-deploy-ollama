# Deploy Ollama and Open WebUI with GitHub Actions 🌐🚀

Welcome to the easiest way to get your own hosted private language model running swiftly with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)

![alt text](screenshot.png)


## Why use this action?

With this action, you can easily get up and running with hosted inference.  We've made it simple to deploy your own LLM and interact with it via the Open WebUI or the API.  This action is perfect for anyone who wants to try out the latest models, ask questions about documents, or even build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) apps against an LLM you own!

🖥️✨ Get started below, and you'll be talking with your own hosted LLM in no time!

Supported Cloud Providers:
- AWS

> **Note:** This action is currently in beta.  Please report any issues you find by creating [an Issue](https://github.com/bitovi/github-actions-deploy-ollama/issues/new) or a [Pull Requests](https://github.com/bitovi/github-actions-deploy-ollama/pulls)

## Requirements

This is a list of requirements you'll need to meet in order to use this action.
1. An AWS account (yep, that's it!)


### 1. An AWS account
You'll need [Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) from an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)


## Example usage

<!-- > **Secrets first!** First, fill out the values in the `.env.example` file. Then, create a secret in your repo called `DOT_ENV` and paste the contents into it. (Do NOT commit any files with your secrets in them!) -->


Create `.github/workflow/deploy.yaml` with the following to build on push.

### Basic example
```yaml
name: Basic deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  EC2-Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - id: deploy
      name: Deploy
      uses: bitovi/github-actions-deploy-ollama@0.1.0
      with:
        aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
```

> Once deployed, visit the url provided in the workflow output summary.

## Environment variables

For envirnoment variables in your app, you can provide:
 - `env_repo` - A file in your repo that contains env vars
 - `env_ghv` - An entry in [Github actions variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)
 - `env_ghs` - An entry in [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/es/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
 - `env_aws_secret` - The path to a JSON format secret in AWS
 

These environment variables are merged (in the following order) to the .env file and provided to both the Prometheus and Grafana services:
 - Terraform passed env vars ( This is not optional nor customizable )
 - Repository checked-in env vars - repo_env file as default. (KEY=VALUE style)
 - Github Secret - Create a secret named DOT_ENV - (KEY=VALUE style)
 - AWS Secret - JSON style like '{"key":"value"}'

## Note about resource identifiers

Most resources will contain the tag `${GITHUB_ORG_NAME}-${GITHUB_REPO_NAME}-${GITHUB_BRANCH_NAME}`, some of them, even the resource name after. 
We limit this to a 60 characters string because some AWS resources have a length limit and short it if needed.

We use the kubernetes style for this. For example, kubernetes -> k(# of characters)s -> k8s. And so you might see some compressions are made.

For some specific resources, we have a 32 characters limit. If the identifier length exceeds this number after compression, we remove the middle part and replace it for a hash made up from the string itself. 

### S3 buckets naming

Buckets names can be made of up to 63 characters. If the length allows us to add -tf-state, we will do so. If not, a simple -tf will be added.

## CERTIFICATES - Only for AWS Managed domains with Route53

As a default, the application will be deployed and the ELB public URL will be displayed.

If `domain_name` is defined, we will look up for a certificate with the name of that domain (eg. `example.com`). We expect that certificate to contain both `example.com` and `*.example.com`. 

If you wish to set up `domain_name` and disable the certificate lookup, set up `no_cert` to true.

Setting `create_root_cert` to `true` will create this certificate with both `example.com` and `*.example.com` for you, and validate them. (DNS validation).

Setting `create_sub_cert` to `true` will create a certificate **just for the subdomain**, and validate it.

> :warning: Be very careful here! **Created certificates are fully managed by Terraform**. Therefor **they will be destroyed upon stack destruction**.

To change a certificate (root_cert, sub_cert, ARN or pre-existing root cert), you must first set the `no_cert` flag to true, run the action, then set the `no_cert` flag to false, add the desired settings and excecute the action again. (**This will destroy the first certificate.**)

This is necessary due to a limitation that prevents certificates from being changed while in use by certain resources.

## Made with BitOps
[BitOps](https://bitops.sh) allows you to define Infrastructure-as-Code for multiple tools in a central place.  This action uses a BitOps [Operations Repository](https://bitops.sh/operations-repo-structure/) to set up the necessary Terraform and Ansible to create infrastructure and deploy to it.
